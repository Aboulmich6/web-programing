<h2>The State of Digital in Lebanon in 2025</h2>
<p>
Lebanon has seen significant adoption of connected devices and online services. As of early 2025, there were approximately 4.68 million cellular mobile connections in the country, representing 80.4% of the population. It is important to note that some of these connections are limited to voice and SMS services and may not include internet access.  
<br>
Internet usage in Lebanon reached 5.34 million individuals, corresponding to an online penetration rate of 91.6%. Social media adoption is similarly high, with 4.02 million users, accounting for 68.9% of the population (DataReportal, 2025). These figures provide a clear overview of digital adoption, but it is also essential to examine trends over time for a full understanding.
</p>

<h3>Internet Usage Trends</h3>
<p>
Between January 2024 and January 2025, the number of internet users in Lebanon increased by 59,000, representing a 1.1% growth. Lebanon’s overall internet adoption rate grew by 0.4% during the same period. Despite these gains, approximately 491,000 people remained offline at the start of 2025, highlighting a segment of the population yet to engage with digital technologies.  
<br>
Data collection and reporting delays can result in figures that slightly underrepresent current usage levels. Therefore, actual adoption and growth rates may be higher than reported.
</p>

<h3>Routing Security in the Middle East</h3>
<p>
Routing security is critical to maintaining a stable and resilient internet infrastructure. As networks expand, the risk of route hijacks and misconfigurations grows, potentially causing service disruptions and data breaches.  

Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) offers a cryptographic framework to secure routing announcements using two main components: Route Origin Authorisation (ROA), which specifies authorized Autonomous Systems (ASes) for IP prefixes, and Route Origin Validation (ROV), which verifies announcements against ROAs and classifies routes as valid, invalid, or not found. Invalid routes are dropped automatically.
<br>
Historical incidents highlight the importance of RPKI. In 2008, a YouTube IP address hijack by Pakistan Telecom caused a global outage before RPKI adoption. In contrast, Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 service disruption in June 2024 and Telegram blocking attempts in Iraq in July 2023 were contained locally due to ROV, demonstrating the framework’s effectiveness (Qasim Lone, 2025).  
<br>
Government-level initiatives are increasingly supporting RPKI deployment. In the Middle East, several countries have achieved high ROA coverage, enhancing network security and reducing the impact of routing misconfigurations.
