        In 1984, building on the earlier ideas of futurist Ted Nelson, Neil Larson released the commercial DOS program <em>MaxThink</em>. 
        This outliner introduced angle-bracket hypertext jumps within ASCII, batch, and other files, supporting links up to 32 levels deep. 
        This innovation became a foundation for later developments in web navigation (Wikipedia, 2025) [1].

        By 1986, Larson had developed <em>Houdini</em>, a DOS program capable of managing 2,500 topics interconnected by 7,500 links in a single file, 
        along with hypertext connections to unlimited external files. Between 1987 and 1989, he introduced <em>TransText</em>, a hypertext word processor, 
        and additional tools for creating large-scale knowledge systems. His software was notably applied to a litigation knowledge system distributed on CD-ROM, 
        which integrated 50,000 files and 200,000 hypertext jumps (Wikipedia, 2025) [1].
    </p>

        Meanwhile, other developers were expanding the possibilities of hypertext. In 1990, Peter Scott and Earle Fogel created <em>HyTelnet</em>, 
        a tool that provided instant access to the online catalogs of over 5,000 libraries worldwide. While HyTelnet emphasized speed and simplicity in link creation, 
        it lacked a centralized structure for managing links — a limitation later resolved through the introduction of the web server (Wikipedia, 2025) [1].

        That same year, Tim Berners-Lee developed the first web browser, <em>WorldWideWeb</em>, for the NeXT computer, alongside the first web server. 
        In 1991, he introduced the system at CERN and collaborated with Nicola Pellow to create the Line Mode Browser, which allowed access from older terminals. 
        This marked the beginning of the modern web (Wikipedia, 2025) [1].

        The web’s popularity surged in 1993 with the release of NCSA Mosaic. Mosaic was revolutionary for its ability to display images inline with text, 
        eliminating the need for separate helper applications. This feature made the web more accessible to non-technical users. 
        Marc Andreessen, a key developer on the Mosaic team, later co-founded Netscape, which released Netscape Navigator in 1994, 
        accelerating consumer adoption of the web (Wikipedia, 2025) [1].

        By the mid-1990s, commercial competition intensified. IBM introduced WebExplorer for OS/2 in early 1995, 
        while UdiWWW became notable for implementing full HTML 3 features, including mathematical markup. 
        That same year, Microsoft entered the market by licensing technology from Spyglass, Inc. to launch Internet Explorer. 
        This triggered the infamous “browser wars” between Microsoft and Netscape, shaping the trajectory of the web browser industry for years to come (Wikipedia, 2025) [1].
